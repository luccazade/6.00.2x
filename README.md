# MIT 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science - my answers

This repository contains my answers to the problem sets and exams for the MIT 6.00.2x course hosted on EdX.

I'm using this for three reasons

1. Version control
2. Proof of work
3. Improve my understanding of GitHub and how it is integrated into the IDE I am using
